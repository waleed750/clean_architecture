  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/
     - assets/images/quote.png
     - lang/
     - assets/fonts/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Tajawal
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Tajawal-Black.ttf
           weight: 900
         - asset: assets/fonts/Tajawal-ExtraBold.ttf
           weight: 800
         - asset: assets/fonts/Tajawal-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
         - asset: assets/fonts/Tajawal-Medium.ttf
           weight: 500
         - asset: assets/fonts/Tajawal-Regular.ttf
           weight: 400
         - asset: assets/fonts/Tajawal-Light.ttf
           weight: 300
         - asset: assets/fonts/Tajawal-ExtraLight.ttf
           weight: 200
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
